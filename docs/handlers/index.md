# Inside your handler

The methods you register are ordinary PHP methods, but they are not cut off from the
protocol. Type-hint a `Mcp\Server\RequestContext` argument anywhere in the signature and
the SDK passes it in — that object is the way back to the client mid-request.

```php
use Mcp\Capability\Attribute\McpTool;
use Mcp\Schema\Content\TextContent;
use Mcp\Server\RequestContext;

#[McpTool]
public function summarize(string $text, RequestContext $context): string
{
    $context->getClientLogger()->info(\sprintf('Summarizing %d characters', \strlen($text)));

    $result = $context->getClientGateway()->sample("Summarize:\n\n".$text, 500);

    // `content` is TextContent|ImageContent|AudioContent
    return $result->content instanceof TextContent ? $result->content->text : '';
}
```

* **[Talking back to the client](client-communication.md)** — the `ClientGateway`:
  asking the client's model for a completion (sampling), reporting progress on a long
  call, and sending notifications.
* **[Logging](logging.md)** — structured PSR-3 log messages that surface in the client,
  not in your server's log file.

Handlers that need application services (a database connection, an API client) get them
from the container instead; see
[Service dependencies](../run/server-builder.md#service-dependencies).
